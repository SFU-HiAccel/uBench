## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
   The KNN algorithm is widely used in many computational demanding applications including image classification, similarity search, and big-data query search. For this case study, we apply a series of HLS optimization techniques and demonstrate the pratical usage of our memory system insights when designing HLS-based KNN accelerator using the software code from the Rodinia benchmark suite - https://github.com/yuhc/gpu-rodinia.git. Here we include the four designs with the configurations enlisted in Table 2, and discussed in Section 5 of our paper.

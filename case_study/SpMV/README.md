## Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)

   The SpMV algorithm is widely used in computational demanding applications like graph processing and machine learning. For this case study, we apply a series of HLS optimization techniques and demonstrate the pratical usage of our memory system insights when designing HLS-based SpMV accelerator using the software code from the MachSuite benchmark suite - https://github.com/breagen/MachSuite.git. Here we include the four designs with the configurations enlisted in Table 4, and discussed in Section 6 of our paper.
